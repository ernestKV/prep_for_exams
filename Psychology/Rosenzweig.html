<h2>Rosenzweig, Bennet, and Diamond (1972) conducted a study on neuroplasticity to determine if environmental stimuli affect brain structure. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to adapt to experiences. At the time, it was believed brain changes occurred only during childhood. The aim was to assess how enriched or impoverished environments influence neuron development in the cerebral cortex.

  <br>
  Three male rats from the same litter were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: the control condition (CC) with three rats in a standard cage, the impoverished condition (IC) with each rat in solitary cages without toys or mazes, and the enriched condition (EC) with 10–12 rats in a cage filled with stimulus objects for exploration and play. All rats had unrestricted access to food and water. After 30–60 days in their environments, the rats were euthanized for brain analysis.

  <br>
  Results showed that rats in the EC had thicker cortices, heavier brains, and increased neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex, particularly in areas associated with acetylcholine transmission, critical for learning and memory. Follow-up studies found similar changes with just 30 minutes of daily exposure to enrichment. This suggests that environmental factors like intellectual and social stimulation significantly influence brain development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The findings imply that human brains may also be affected by environmental factors, as seen in the cognitive risks posed by poverty, such as poor nutrition and limited access to education. However, it remains unclear whether environmental changes or social interaction primarily drove the results. Studies isolating these factors found that solitary rats in enriched environments did not exhibit similar effects unless they actively engaged with the objects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study was a controlled lab experiment, enabling cause-and-effect conclusions. However, generalizing results to humans is challenging, and it is uncertain how social interaction, stimulation, and exercise interact. The results have been widely replicated, reinforcing their validity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethical concerns arise due to potential stress and harm to the animals, including isolation, impoverishment, and euthanasia. A cost-benefit analysis must justify the harm caused by the study in light of its scientific contributions.</h2>
