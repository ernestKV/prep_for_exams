<h2>Transgenic mice were used to study the role of serotonin in aggression, contributing to research on genes and behavior. This approach is valuable for understanding the biological basis of human behavior using animal models. These models often involve replicating genetic mutations observed in humans to assess their impact on behavior.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transgenic mice are genetically modified to include a foreign gene or sequence. For example, Cases et al. (1995) conducted a study using knockout mice, where the gene regulating monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) was deleted. MAOA is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The absence of this gene led to MAOA-deficient mice, exhibiting heightened aggressive behaviors.

  <br>
  Between days 11 and 16, these transgenic mice displayed symptoms of low MAOA, including frantic running, violent shaking during sleep, and biting behavior. Adult male mice showed offensive aggression, such as bite wounds. In "resident-intruder" tests, the transgenic mice adopted aggressive postures and attacked intruders, contrasting with control mice that displayed exploratory behaviors. Autopsies revealed significantly elevated serotonin levels (six to nine times higher than controls), moderate increases in norepinephrine, and slightly elevated dopamine levels.

  <br>
  The study established a cause-and-effect relationship between the MAOA deficiency and aggression in mice. The findings suggest that MAOA-deficient humans may also have a predisposition to aggression, influenced by social and environmental factors. Human studies, such as those by Brunner et al. (1993), McDermott et al. (2009), Tiihonen et al. (2014), and Caspi et al. (2002), corroborate the animal model's findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, Brunner (1993) identified a variation in the MAOA gene among aggressive males in a Dutch family, resulting in low enzyme levels and elevated neurotransmitter activity. Similarly, McDermott et al. (2009) found that humans with the MAOA variation exhibited more aggressive behavior in a controlled experiment. Tiihonen et al. (2014) linked MAOA gene variations to violent crime among Finnish offenders. These studies confirm the gene's role in aggression but also highlight the necessity of gene-environment interactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  While animal models offer insights unattainable in human experiments, ethical concerns persist. The permanent damage caused to animals and the questionable applicability of such models to human aggression remain topics of debate. Most individuals with the MAOA polymorphism do not exhibit aggressive behaviors, emphasizing the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social factors in shaping behavior.</h2>
