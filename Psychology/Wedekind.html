<h2>Wedekind et al. (1995) conducted the "Sweaty T-Shirt Study" to explore the role of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)—genes vital to immune system functioning—in mate selection. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that mate preferences are influenced by natural selection, favoring genetic diversity to enhance offspring immunity. The study hypothesized that individuals are subconsciously attracted to partners with dissimilar MHC genes.

  The study involved 49 female and 44 male university students with diverse MHC profiles. Men wore unscented cotton T-shirts for two nights while avoiding behaviors that could alter their natural scent. Women later rated the odors of seven T-shirts: three from men with similar MHC, three with dissimilar MHC, and one unworn control shirt. Testing occurred during women’s most odor-sensitive phase of their menstrual cycle.

  Results showed that women rated the scents of men with dissimilar MHC genes as more pleasant and attractive. However, women using oral contraceptives showed a reversed preference, favoring similar MHC scents, likely due to hormonal changes mimicking pregnancy conditions. This suggests that body odor cues influence subconscious mate preferences.

  The study supports evolutionary theories of mate selection, showing that scent may signal genetic compatibility. Conducted as a double-blind experiment, it minimized bias and adhered to ethical standards. However, the homogeneous sample limits generalizability, and critics argue the theory oversimplifies human mate selection by neglecting cognitive and sociocultural factors. Despite these limitations, the findings align with other research on MHC’s role in attraction and reproductive health.</h2>
