<h2>Caspi et al. (2003) conducted a study to investigate the role of gene mutation and epigenetics in major depressive disorder, focusing on the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental stressors. The study is relevant to the biological approach, specifically in understanding the genetic inheritance of behavior and the etiology of depression.

  The study tested the diathesis-stress model, which suggests that genetic factors interact with environmental stressors to influence depression. Caspiâ€™s team looked at a sample of 847 New Zealand participants, categorized by their 5-HTT gene alleles: two short alleles, one short and one long allele, and two long alleles. The serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) plays a role in serotonin reuptake in the brain, affecting mood. Participants completed a "Stressful Life Events" questionnaire and were assessed for depression. The results showed that individuals with one or more short 5-HTT alleles showed more depression and suicidal thoughts in response to stressful life events. However, the gene alone did not cause depression; it was the interaction with stress that increased the risk.

  A follow-up study by Wilhelm et al. (2006) found that 80% of individuals with two short 5-HTT alleles developed depression after three or more negative life events in a year, while only 30% of those with two long alleles did. Childhood maltreatment predicted depression only in those with the short allele.

  Although the study found a gene-environment interaction, it is correlational, meaning no cause-and-effect relationship can be established. The self-reported nature of life events may also influence the results. While the study acknowledges both genetic and environmental factors in depression, it has faced challenges in replication. A meta-analysis by Risch et al. (2009) found that the results could not be reliably reproduced, suggesting low reliability. Furthermore, some participants without the gene mutation still developed depression, indicating that gene expression alone may not be sufficient to cause the disorder. Further research is needed to clarify the gene's role in depression.</h2>
