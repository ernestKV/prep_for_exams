<h2>Weaver et al. (2004) demonstrated how maternal behavior influences offspring stress responses by altering the epigenome at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene promoter in the hippocampus. The study focused on the effects of high levels of maternal licking and grooming (LG) and arched-back nursing (ABN) in rats, which were associated with reduced stress responses in offspring. The researchers found that offspring of high-LG-ABN mothers had reduced DNA methylation at the GR gene promoter, leading to increased GR expression. In contrast, offspring of low-LG-ABN mothers exhibited increased DNA methylation, resulting in lower GR expression and heightened stress responses.

  These epigenetic differences appeared during the first week of life and persisted into adulthood, but they were reversible through cross-fostering. Histone acetylation and binding of the transcription factor NGFI-A to the GR promoter were also influenced by maternal care. When offspring were treated with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, the differences in histone acetylation, DNA methylation, NGFI-A binding, GR expression, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were eliminated, suggesting a causal relationship between these factors and stress regulation.

  The study highlighted that maternal behavior can program the epigenomic state of offspring, affecting stress hormone regulation and behavior. Importantly, this programming was shown to be reversible, demonstrating the plasticity of epigenetic modifications. Weaver et al.'s findings underscore the value of animal research in elucidating the connections between environment, gene expression, and hormonal regulation, providing critical insights into how early-life experiences shape physiological and psychological health.</h2>
