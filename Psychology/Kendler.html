<h2>A study aimed to investigate the heritability of lifetime major depression and whether genetic influences differ between men and women. It also examined whether genetic risk factors for major depression vary across historical cohorts. The study used data from 42,161 twins, including 15,493 complete pairs, from the Swedish Twin Registry. Major depression was assessed through personal interviews using modified DSM-IV criteria, and twin models were evaluated with the Mx program.

  The results showed that the heritability of major depression was significantly higher in women (42%) compared to men (29%). Genetic risk factors for major depression were found to be moderately correlated between the sexes. The study found no significant differences in the roles of genetic and environmental factors in major depression across three cohorts born between 1900 and 1958.

  The findings suggest that lifetime major depression is moderately heritable, with estimates similar to those in prior studies. The study supports the idea that the heritability of major depression is higher in women than in men and that some genetic risk factors may be sex-specific. However, there was no evidence for differences in the roles of genetic and environmental risk factors across the birth cohorts.</h2>
