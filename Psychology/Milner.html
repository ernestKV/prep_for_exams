    <title>HM: Milner (1966)</title>
</head>

<h2>Milner’s classic case study of HM explored the role of the hippocampus in memory formation. HM, born in 1926, suffered severe epilepsy after a head injury at age 7. At 27, experimental surgery removed his medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, to control seizures, resulting in significant anterograde amnesia. Milner studied him for over 50 years using various methods: psychometric testing, behavioral observations, interviews, cognitive tests (e.g., reverse mirror drawing), and later MRI scans by Corkin.

    HM retained childhood memories and above-average IQ but could not form new episodic or semantic memories, showing that the hippocampus is essential for transferring short-term to long-term memory. He maintained procedural memory, demonstrated by his ability to learn motor tasks like mirror drawing, despite never recalling learning them. This suggested that different brain areas manage implicit and procedural memory.<br>

    MRI scans in 1992 and 2003 confirmed hippocampal damage but less extensive than initially thought, linking this area to memory formation. Findings included that short-term memory does not reside in the hippocampus, as HM could hold information briefly with rehearsal. The medial temporal region organizes memories for permanent storage elsewhere in the brain.<br>

    Strengths of this longitudinal case study include method triangulation and high ecological validity. However, its limitations include the inability to replicate and retrospective gaps in pre-surgery data. HM’s case, while unique, is supported by similar studies like Clive Wearing's. Ethical considerations were maintained, with informed consent, confidentiality, and no harm to HM.</h2>
